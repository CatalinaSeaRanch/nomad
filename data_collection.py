#To read ADC values - for battery voltage and current sense amplifier output - 
#using Arduino, output via serial



# To communicate I2C with Atlas Scientific Sensors - easiest to use A9
# with drivers / methods from pi image hosted by Atlas - avoid arduino? Libraries may
# be available for either



# Vemco Acoustic Receiver - 96008N1 - Tag ID / TIME






#Seabird MicroCAT - 96008n1 - Conducitivity / DO / Pressure / TEMP (?)





#to read temp of NEO processor: cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
# import commands
#//need to replace print with casting to internal temp variable
#print(commands.getstatusoutput("cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp"))
